      "Sentiment: 1\n\nBefore (813 chars):\nAn excellent film depicting the cross currents in the lives of a multi-ethnic mix of not so ordinary people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Solid directing and writing along with fine acting, especially the performances by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful \\Crash,\\\" written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as frantic as that in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better acquainted with each other in \\\"Apart From That,\\\" but the personal relationships of the characters are as flawed and troubled and their stories as resonant as any of those in \\\"Crash.\\\" For those viewers who appreciated \\\"Crash\\\" this is a must see film. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will like this movie.\"\n\nAfter (421 chars):\nexcel film depict cross current live mix ordinari peopl rural pacif northwest solid direct write along fine act especi perform kwami taha dan stow interestingli film made year highli success written direct paul haggi pace action may frantic urban lo angel charact may seem better acquaint apart person relationship charact flaw troubl stori reson viewer appreci must see film also fan jim jarmusch john cassavet like movi\n"
